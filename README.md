The objective of the game is to destroy the tower/wall using characters with unique abilities. The characters can be bought and deployed anywhere before the base line. Characters can be bought using Elixir, an ingame currency that uses a timer to auto-fill. The user must strategically spend this elixir on characters that will complete the objective before the time runs out. The tower/wall also use weopons like canons and arrows to shoot our characters. This game has 3 difficulty levels which can only be unlocked after completing the previous level.
